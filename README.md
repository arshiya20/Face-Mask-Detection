# Face-Mask-Detection
In the recent times, the Corona virus have become very common, contagious and dangerous 
to the whole human kind. Since we are amidst the pandemic and it is not very long since the 
first wave left us devastated and second wave is right here ,it becomes our prime objective to 
contribute in this scenario as per our capability. The most affected and devastating condition 
is of India due to its extreme population in small area.
As our country starts going through various stages of reopening after the COVID-19 
pandemic, World Health Organization has declared the use of a face mask as a mandatory 
biosafety measure. Face masks are necessary in general public to curtail the spread of 
coronavirus. To mandate the use of facemask, it becomes essential to devise some technique 
that enforce individuals to apply a mask before exposure to public places. 
This project focuses on identifying whether the person is wearing the mask (correctly) or not. 
In the present scenario due to Covid-19, there is no efficient face mask detection applications, 
but they are now in high demand for transportation areas, places for the social gatherings, 
large scale manufacturing areas and other enterprises to ensure safety.
We have used convolutional neural network for the same. The model is trained on a real 
world dataset and tested with live video streaming with a good accuracy. Further the accuracy 
of the model with different hyper parameters and multiple people at different distance and 
location of the frame is done.
